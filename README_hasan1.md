### An analysis of World Happiness Report between years 2005 - 2021

#### Glossary: 

Life Ladder: 
It asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.

Healthy life expectancy at birth:
Healthy Life Expectancy (at birth) is the average number of years a person would expect to live in good health in a particular area based on modern mortality rates in that area and prevalence of self-reported good health.

### Question: Is there any coreleation between Life Ladder and Healthy life expectancy at birth?

As a first step,  we check the whole available data of World Happiness Report between 2005 and 2021 for "Life Ladder" and "Healthy Life of Expectance at Birth". Please see fig1
